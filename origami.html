            <Li>            There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.         </Li>

            <Li>        The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.
                Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window.           </Li>
